# Learn_Machine_Learning
Convolutional Neural Networks Algorithm applied on German Traffic Lights Data Set. 
THe Machine Learning Model is trained to predict the state of traffic and street signs based on Image Recognition.

The model is initially trained on 20 Epoches.
It is ready to be deployed to some Mobile, Web, or Desktop Application.
